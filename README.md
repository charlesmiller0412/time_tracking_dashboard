## My process

### Built with

-   CSS custom properties
-   CSS Grid
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

**CSS Grid** - This project was great for understanding how CSS grid works. I had never actually used it before as I'm a big fan of flexbox, but this proved that grid has it's purpose.

### Useful resources

-   [CSS-Tricks Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This was great for understanding how to alter grid by size or count.
